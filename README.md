# Proportional-Navigation
This is a very simple basic example of how proportional navigation works. 

# The Difference between the zip and the .m file
The zip file contains everything in order to run the code such as peripheral functions
while the .m file is just the codes itself in case if the codes needs to be seen without downloading it.

# Purpose
The purpose of this project was as an introduction Matlab class in which I made this as my final project. This project idea existed before hand, but this project gave me an opportunity to learn the skills involved. The final goal is to be able to track a projectile and predict its motion using a webcam. This was just a proof of concept.

There is a small bug in the code, I have yet to fix, or have yet had a reason to fix. As time increases mass/momentum of the dot you are controlling also increases. Making tighter turns harder to make. It is workable for shorter demonstartions under about 10 seconds, but beyond that it would need to be fixed.
